# Reviewing guide

All reviewers must abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); they are also protected by the code of conduct.
A reviewer should not tolerate poor behavior and is encouraged to [report any behavior](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#reporting-problems) that violates the code of conduct.

## Review process

The Summer CMS team has a well-defined review process that must be followed by reviewers in all repositories under the Summer CMS organization.
This process is described in detail in the [what happens after the report is filed](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#what-happens-after-the-report-is-filed) section on the code of conduct page.
