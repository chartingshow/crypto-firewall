#### Crypto Annoyances (Optional Step) 🚀

The file `crypto-annoyances-adblock.txt` is a filter list that contains rules and filters to block various annoyances and unwanted content specifically related to cryptocurrency websites and related platforms.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/master/src/blacklists/crypto-annoyances-adblock.txt
```

Here's a breakdown of what the `crypto-annoyances-adblock.txt` file does:

1.  **General Annoyance Blocking**:
    *   Removes parameters from URLs (like `utm_` parameters used for tracking).
    *   Blocks cookie consent prompts and banners.

2.  **Social Media Blocks**:
    *   Targets specific elements on social media platforms to remove promoted content.

3.  **TradingView Annoyances**:
    *   Hides popups, notifications and other distracting elements on TradingView.
    *   Blocks telemetry and tracking scripts.

4.  **Exchange Blocks**:
    *   Removes compliance banners on Binance, Coinbase and other crypto exchanges.
    *   Removes banners and pop-ups.

5.  **Crypto Blocks**:
    *   Targets various cryptocurrency-related websites (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, etc.).
    *   Hides or removes elements such as ads, banners, social media feeds and other promotional content.

In summary, this filter list aims to provide a cleaner, less distracting experience when browsing cryptocurrency-related websites by blocking common annoyances, ads and tracking mechanisms.

#### Manifest V3: How Google Chrome's Update Affects Ad-Blockers 🇬

Google Chrome's Manifest V3, rolled out in June 2024, will significantly impact ad-blockers and other browser extensions. This update limits extensions to 30,000 rules, far below the 300,000 rules many ad-blockers currently use to function effectively. The change from the webRequest API to the declarativeNetRequest API will reduce ad-blockers' flexibility and ability to update rules in real-time.

While some ad-blockers like AdGuard, uBlock Origin Lite, and Ghostery have adapted to Manifest V3, users may notice decreased effectiveness in blocking ads. This move has sparked controversy, with critics arguing it gives Google more control over extensions and potentially benefits its advertising business. As a result, some users are considering alternative browsers like Firefox, which has committed to continuing support for Manifest V2.

### Operating System Blocking 🌟

For system-wide protection, consider modifying your device's hosts file:

<ul>
    <li><p><img src="https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/assets/images/linux.png" alt="Linux" width="16" height="16" /> <a href="https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/docs/help-guides/linux-hosts-instructions.md"><strong>Linux Hosts File Instructions Guide</strong></a> - Edit the hosts file to block unwanted domains at the system level.</p></li>
    <li><p><img src="https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/assets/images/mac-os.png" alt="MacOS" width="16" height="16" /> <a href="https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/docs/help-guides/mac-hosts-instructions.md"><strong>MacOS Hosts File Instructions Guide</strong></a> - Modify the hosts file to prevent access to specific websites and services.</p></li>
    <li><p><img src="https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/assets/images/microsoft.png" alt="Windows" width="16" height="16" /> <a href="https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/docs/help-guides/windows-hosts-instructions.md"><strong>Windows Hosts File Instructions Guide</strong></a> - Update the hosts file to block connections to undesired IP addresses.</p></li>
</ul>

- **Intel i5** - use `full` version (if you experience bad performance then try `lite` version instead).
- **Intel i7** - use `mega` version (if you experience bad performance then try `full` version instead).
- **Intel i9** - use `beta` or `mega` (if you experience bad performance then try `full` version instead).

Here's a suggested guide based on device:

- **Mobile** or **Tablet** - use `full` version (if you experience bad performance then try `lite` version instead).
- **Laptop** or **Computer** - use `beta` or `mega` version (if you experience bad performance then try `full` version instead).

## Free DNS / Hosting blocking 🆓

This repo blocks specific free dns / hosting services, that are completely saturated with hosting malware and viruses. This is to reduce the size of the filter lists and increase the performance. A list of services currently blocked can be found in the folder here:

- [Free DNS/Hosting Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/free-dns-hosting/)

## Malicious Package Names blocking 👨‍💻

Malicious apps are a method of manipulating users into downloading malware that allows cybercriminals to steal personal information, including login credentials or payment information. It's also possible that they can even take control of a user's device. A list of package names currently blocked can be found in the folder here:

- [Malicious Package Names Folder](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/package-names/)

## Autonomous System Number (ASN) blocking 🗃️

An Autonomous System Number (ASN) is a globally unique 16-digit identification number assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to Autonomous Systems (AS). ASNs are crucial for routing within networks and exchanging routing information with other Internet Service Providers. Autonomous systems numbered one to 64511 are available by IANA for global use. The 64512 to 65535 series is reserved for private and reserved purposes.

An Autonomous System Number (ASN) can also be blocked, be aware that ASN's contain a load of ip addresses assigned to them. You can add them to a firewall of your choice.

The ASN block list can be found here:

- [ASN Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/asn.txt)

## IP blocking 🌐

IP Addresses can also be blocked, these contain things such as command-and-control (C2) servers for crypto malware etc. You can add them to a firewall of your choice.

The IP block list can be found here:

- [IP Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/ip.txt)
- [IP Filter AdBlock List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/ip-adblock.txt)

For a thorough explanation on how to add block an ip address in your firewall, you can open one of the help guides found in this folder:

- https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/tree/master/docs

### Custom IP Block Lists 📋

These custom IP address filter lists block specific malware and can be found in the folder:

- https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/tree/master/src/blacklists/custom-ip-block-lists

> The reason why these custom lists aren't in the main IP filter list is because these IP addresses maybe shared and used for public access or hosting multiple domains! These custom IP address filter lists are for advanced users who can customize them in order to not block their access or applications.

## Email blocking 📧

Email addresses can be blocked, our email block list contains known Crypto scammers, Ransomware, Sextortion and Blackmail email addresses.

The Email block list can be found here:

- [Email Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/email.txt)

How to Identify a Ransomware Email Attack, see here:

- https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/docs/scams/how-to-identify-a-ransomware-email-attack.md

## Nuisance and scam calling telephone numbers blocking ☎️

It's essential to note that tech support scammers often use spoofed or fake numbers to disguise their true location and identity. These numbers may appear legitimate, but they are actually being used to perpetuate fraudulent activities.

Remember, if you receive a suspicious call or message claiming to be from technical support, hang up immediately and do not provide any personal or financial information. Report the incident to the relevant authorities and take steps to secure your device.

A list of spam blocking mobile apps can be found here:

- [Mobile Apps To Block Spam Calls](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/spam-calls/list.md)

## Fraudulent cryptocurrency wallet addresses 🕵️

Avoid sending cryptocurrency to bad actors and scammers, a list of bad blockchain wallet addresses can be found here in this folder:

- [Wallets Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/blockchain-wallet-addresses/)

## Fraudulent cryptocurrency mining pool addresses 🦈

Avoid joining bad cryptocurrency mining pools, a list of bad blockchain mining pool addresses can be found here in this folder:

- [Mining Pools Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/blob/master/src/blacklists/mining-pools-addresses/)

## OFAC sanctioned digital currency addresses 🚫

OFAC publishes lists of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers designated under programs that are not country-specific. OFAC may add **digital currency addresses** to the SDN List to alert the public of specific **digital currency identifiers** associated with a blocked person.

The OFAC Sanctioned Digital Currency Addresses lists can be found in this folder:

- [OFAC Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/tree/master/src/ofac-sanctioned-digital-currency-addresses)

### How do we define sanctions data?

Sanctioned entities refer to entities listed on economic/trade embargo lists, such as by the US, EU, or UN, with which anyone subject to those jurisdictions is prohibited from dealing. Currently, this includes the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list of the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

You can search the full list of OFAC Specially Designated Nationals in OFAC's [sanctions database](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists).

## Ad server blocking 🇦🇩

The ad banners that you see all over the web are stored on servers. Stopping your computer communicating with another computer can be quite simple. So, if you have a list of the servers used for ad banners, it's easy to stop ad banners even getting to your browser.

These custom ad server filter block lists can be found in the folder:

- [Ad Server Filter List](https://github.com/chartingshow/crypto-firewall/tree/master/src/blacklists/ad-servers)
