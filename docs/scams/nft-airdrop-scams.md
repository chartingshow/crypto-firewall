## Protect Yourself from Cyber Criminals Defrauding Hedera Hashgraph Network Users

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is issuing this announcement to inform individuals about a recent scheme where cyber criminals are defrauding cryptocurrency users through nonfungible token (NFT) airdrops disguised as free rewards or incentives for Hedera Hashgraph network users.

### How the Scam Works

Cyber criminals are exploiting the NFT airdrop feature embedded in non-custodial wallets to collect victim data and steal cryptocurrency. Here's how:

*   Users receive unsolicited or promotional cryptocurrency tokens and rewards in their non-custodial wallet as part of the airdrop process.
*   A plaintext "memo" section appears, which may include a URL to a third-party website.
*   Users are required to click the URL to accept the tokens or rewards, which compromises their login and security information, including seed phrases.

### Protect Yourself

To avoid falling victim to this scam, follow these tips:

*   Verify the offer is from the cryptocurrency provider before accepting and/or providing any information.
*   Do not respond to requests to provide personally identifying information, like passwords, seed phrases, or one-time passwords sent to your accounts if you did not initiate the outreach.
*   Initiate a new call to the company using the verified customer service number if a "representative" reaches out to you via phone or email soliciting personal information.
*   Do not click links or use numbers provided in suspicious emails for confirmation communication is legitimate.
*   Use verified customer service numbers provided by the company on official communications.
*   Monitor cryptocurrency accounts for suspicious login attempts, unauthorized changes to the account, unrecognized transactions, or compromised credentials.

### Victim Reporting and Additional Information

If you suspect that you or someone you know are a victim of a Hedera Hashgraph network cryptocurrency scam:

*   Contact your account providers immediately to regain control of your accounts, change passwords, and place alerts on your accounts for suspicious login attempts and/or transactions.
*   Be cautious of individuals or companies claiming they can assist in recovering funds lost in scams, as this may be an additional scam.
*   Submit a report with as much detail as possible to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at www.ic3.gov.
