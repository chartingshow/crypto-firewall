## Anti-Harassment Policy

**Version 1.0 – Updated January 1, 2023**

### 1. Purpose

"Harassment" consists of any unwanted conduct that violates an individual's
dignity or constitutes victimisation, or which creates an intimidating, bullying,
abusive, hostile, degrading, humiliating, offensive or otherwise uncomfortable
environment. This includes harassment related to the protected characteristics
of sex, race, national origin, ethnic origin, age, disability, sexual orientation,
gender reassignment, religion or belief. It can involve a single incident or may
be persistent and may be directed towards one or more individuals.

Summer CMS does not tolerate acts of harassment committed by team members, or by
third parties against its team members. Please note that harassment can be a
criminal offence, punishable by fines and even imprisonment. Harassment is
unacceptable both in the work place and in any work-related setting outside of
the work place such as business trips or business-related social events.

If you have been subject to, or have witnessed, any acts of harassment on
and/or off Summer CMS's premises you may use this procedure to make a
complaint.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies equally to full time and part time team members on a
substantive or fixed-term contract and to associated persons who work for
Summer CMS such as secondees, agency staff, contractors and others employed
under a contract of service.

### 3. Unacceptable behaviour

Harassment, bullying and/or victimisation may constitute gross misconduct.
The discrimination policy procedures, whether formal or informal, may be invoked
where there is evidence of misconduct and/or gross misconduct. Sanctions
may include summary dismissal.

Please note that victimisation of or retaliation upon anyone who makes a
complaint in good faith or assists in the investigation of alleged harassment is
in itself a disciplinary offence and may lead to summary dismissal.

Single or continual acts may constitute harassment. In general, conduct
becomes harassment if it persists once it has become clear that the recipient
regards it as offensive.

All complaints will be dealt with confidentially and promptly and you may seek
support or advice from your line manager and/or Human Resources at any
stage.

Summer CMS encourages prompt reporting of complaints or concerns regarding
harassment because prompt reporting and intervention has proved to be the
most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of
harassment. Under normal circumstances, a complaint must be made as soon
as possible and, in any event, within two weeks of the alleged incident (or the
last of such alleged incidents) taking place.

All individuals involved in any harassment complaint will be asked to maintain
the confidentiality of the discussions which are held.

Summer CMS will treat all complaints of harassment seriously, however if it is
established during any investigation that you have made a capricious, false or
malicious accusation or your complaint is without foundation, then you yourself
may be subject to disciplinary action.

The following list is not exhaustive but is intended to provide a number of
examples of unacceptable behaviour:

- Unwanted physical contact such as unnecessary touching or
  brushing against another employee's body, patting, pinching,
  insulting or abusive behaviour or gestures, physical threats, assault,
  coerced sexual intercourse or rape.

- Unwanted verbal conduct such as unwelcome advances, patronising
  nicknames, propositions or remarks, innuendo, lewd comments,
  jokes, banter or abusive language, which refer to an individual or a
  group's race, nationality, ethnic origin, age, language, religion or
  similar belief, political or other opinion, affiliation, gender, gender
  reassignment, sexual orientation, marital status or civil partnership,
  connections with a national minority, national or social origin,
  property, birth or other status, family connections, or disability, etc.

- Repeated suggestions for unwanted social activities.

- Unwanted non-verbal conduct such as graffiti referring to an
  individual's characteristics or private life, abusive or offensive
  gestures, leering, whistling, display of pornographic or sexually
  suggestive literature, pictures, films, objects, or inappropriate use of
  network systems for this purpose.

- Bullying, including persistent inappropriate criticism and personal
  abuse and/or ridicule, either in public or private, which humiliates or
  demeans those involved.

- Unlawful victimisation such as treating an individual less favourably
  than others are, or would be treated in the same or similar
  circumstances, because they have made a complaint or allegation of
  discrimination or have acted as a witness in connection with
  proceedings under any anti-discrimination legislation.

- Any other conduct that denigrates an individual or group.

### 4. Informal action

If you are the subject of harassment you may deal with the matter informally
and/or formally. If you have been subject to, or have witnessed, harassment,
victimisation or bullying and if you feel able you should tell the person(s)
responsible for the behaviour in question that it is offensive and that it must
stop. You must explain what behaviour you find unacceptable, unwelcome or
embarrassing.

Alternatively, you may prefer to put your complaint in writing to the person(s)
responsible for the behaviour in question; or, to ask a work colleague or
Human Resources to speak to the person(s) on your behalf. You must keep a
note of all relevant details.

This approach may be sufficient to correct a situation where those involved
were unaware of causing offence. However, if an informal approach is
unsuccessful or you continue to be subjected to the behaviour, you may prefer
to raise the matter formally.

### 5. Formal action

#### Statement of harassment

Whether or not informal action has been taken, if you have been subject to, or
have witnessed, harassment you can raise the matter directly with your line
manager in writing. You must provide as much detail as possible of the
alleged harassment. If required, you will be invited to a meeting to discuss the
matter in more detail prior to any investigation taking place.

Depending on the circumstances, you may raise the matter directly with
Human Resources or speak to your line manager who will inform Human
Resources. Your complaint will be treated sensitively, seriously and
confidentially.

Both the complainant and the alleged offender have the right to be
accompanied by a work colleague or a trade union official to any subsequent
meeting. Where any party chooses not to be accompanied this will be noted.
Colleagues attending any meeting may ask questions of clarification and
confer with you but may not answer questions on your behalf.

#### Investigation

An investigating manager not previously involved in the case, will be assigned
to collect details of the alleged harassment and to allow the alleged offender to
give his/her side of the case. This may include meetings and gathering
witness statements, where relevant. The investigating manager will draft a
factual written report of the investigation. Where appropriate, the alleged
offender may be transferred to another work area during the investigation
procedure or suspended on full pay.

The alleged offender will be given the opportunity to see the written complaint
against him/her, but only in exceptional circumstances will he/she be allowed
to speak to you directly.

#### Meeting

You will be invited to attend a meeting conducted by an independent manager
in order to discuss the matter. This shall take place as soon as is reasonably
practicable. You should take all reasonable steps to attend the meeting.
Human Resources will be present to ensure the steps described in this policy
are followed and to take minutes.

The independent manager will confirm in writing to all parties involved, usually
within 10 working days of the date of the meeting, that either:

- Harassment has occurred and the discrimination policy procedures shall
  be invoked, or

- No harassment has occurred.

You will be notified of your right to appeal against the decision.

If the complaint is well-founded, it may be necessary to separate the parties; to
the extent this is possible.

#### Appeal

Where you consider, as complainant, that the matter has not been
satisfactorily resolved, you may appeal by informing Human Resources of the
grounds for your appeal in writing, within 7 working days of being notified of
the independent manager's decision.

An independent senior manager, not previously involved in the case, will
consider the appeal. This shall take place as soon as is reasonably
practicable at an appeal meeting to which all parties involved shall be invited.
Human Resources will be present to ensure the steps described in this policy
are followed and to take minutes.

The independent senior manager will confirm in writing to all parties involved,
usually within 14 working days of the date of the appeal meeting, that either:

- Harassment has occurred and the discrimination policy procedures shall
  be invoked, or

- No harassment has occurred.

This decision is final and no further appeal within Summer CMS may be made.

Where harassment has been proved a report of the stages and outcome of the
procedure shall remain for up to 18 months at Summer CMS's discretion on the
Human Resources file of the person found responsible for causing the
harassment.

## Modifications to this Policy

This policy is for guidance only and Summer CMS may amend the policy from time to time and may also vary the procedures it sets out where appropriate in a particular case. Your agreement to comply with the policy will be deemed agreement to any changes to it.
